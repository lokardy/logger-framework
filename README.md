# logger-framework:

The purpose of the project is to show how we can design a logger framework with below requirement:
1. Should be able to write multiple sources. Framework should be extensible enough so that we can add more sources in the future.
2. Single and multiple threads can write methods.
3. Should be able to wrap custom date formats or decorate messages with time stamps and thread Ids

As usual in design there isn't right or wrong approach so any reviews/comemnts are welcome.
